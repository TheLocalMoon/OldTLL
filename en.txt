-----monsters
name_monster_potbelly_adult=Potbelly
bio_monster_potbelly_adult=The adult potbelly is a loud and extroverted creature, constantly babbling nonsense to everyone who can hear. Whilst other monsters would love to stay around and listen, eventually a potbelly may take off its pot and settle into the jabber, sometimes not even noticing the rooty tendrils engulfing it’s eager listener. Luckily, these days monsters have learned to stay away or gently remind the potbelly, and things go smooth from there.
costume_monster_potbelly_adult_2=Impastah
costume_monster_potbelly_adult_3=Wally W

name_monster_tweedle_adult=Tweedle
bio_monster_tweedle_adult=Adult Tweedles are known to migrate a lot from island to island, sometimes they travel to visit their friends while they also sometimes live on one once they get to understand it a lot with the help of their fellow monsters, a true adventuring bird we must say!!!
costume_monster_tweedle_adult_2=Chill chick

name_monster_toejammer_adult=Toe jammer
bio_monster_toejammer_adult=Adult Toe Jammers have a great bubbly personality and are very good swimmers when they live in the water, they are also known to get invited to many parties and picnics with their fellow friend Floot-Fly, they always know how to have a good time!!!"
Adult dandidoo : "Adult Dandidoos are always "dooing" many things across the landscapes, they always bring in a great monster crowd with their fluffy hair but do be careful when Spunge is around them!!!
costume_monster_toejammer_adult_2=There's always room
costume_monster_toejammer_adult_3=A sophisticated droplet
costume_monster_toejammer_adult_4=Legal alien

name_monster_flootfly_adult=Flootfly
bio_monster_flootfly_adult=The mystical Floot Fly is one of the most common monsters to stumble upon throughout the Lost Landscapes, as it's one of the friendliest monsters around! Floot-Flies love to throw tea parties in the most bizarre locations too! Invites to a tea party are always revered and accepted gleefully, as it's a great place to socialize and gossip!
costume_monster_flootfly_adult_2=Faerie Berry

name_monster_dandidoo_adult=Dandidoo
bio_monster_dandidoo_adult=As the warm flows of the ocean carry oysters around the deeps, a gentle breeze carries Dandidoo across the monster world. Their migrations rely on airflow since nature wasn't kind enough to grant them wings. They can conduct the air through their bodies to store and burst it out in a powerful stream of tuned tones and semitones. That's why their singing resembles "doo"s and "dee"s.\nTheir plant element gave them a greenish hue and afro-styled hair reminiscent of a common dandelion.
costume_monster_dandidoo_adult_2=Hot chick

name_monster_oaktopus_adult=Oaktopus
bio_monster_oaktopus_adult=Oaktopi are packed full of wisdom to share with the world, about the world. They almost always have an answer to some of life's most burning questions; "Why is the sky blue?", "Is water wet?", and most notably, "Is mayonnaise an instrument?" (The answer is inconclusive, there is no mayonnaise monster). Sometimes they even say outlandish claims of islands once being carried by towering creatures across the monster world. Psh, yeah right. An Oaktopus can usually be seen reading a good book or swimming in a local hot spring.
costume_monster_oaktopus_adult_2=Doc Oak
costume_monster_oaktopus_adult_3=Serious business

name_monster_quibble_adult=Quibble
bio_monster_quibble_adult=The Quibble may seem like a graceful monster on the outside, but that's just a facade. The two heads constantly bicker, usually having polar opinions about the latest trends, or some other trivial issue. One time, the left Quibble wanted to order fries, but the right Quibble was eager to get a milkshake... chaos ensued. But in the end, they always make up with each other, like true siblings. Oh yeah, they ended up ordering fries dunked in a milkshake. A... unique consensus
costume_monster_quibble_adult_2=Dark mode

name_monster_kikimora_adult=Varow
vargan+prow+crow
bio_monster_kikimora_adult=Known for its penchant for hunting, the melodic “Yah-ha-ha!” of the Varow echoes throughout all corners of the Evergreen Swamp. It uses its call and prolonged noseharp to attempt to attract juvenile fwogs to its corner of the swamp, even though it might not work as often as it likes. In fact, its attempts more often scare its slippery prey away, leaving the Varow fwogless and alone. It’s a sad thing too, since it truly just wants new customers to sample their fresh home-made sweets!
costume_monster_kikimora_adult_2=Big shot

name_monster_spunge_adult=Spunge
bio_monster_spunge_adult=Adult Spunges are very talented whistlers, they can blow so hard that sometimes they send fellow monsters off to faraway islands!!! Just Remember to take cover when they blow their birthday candles
costume_monster_spunge_adult_2=Rusty sponge

name_monster_bannik_adult=Banno
bio_monster_bannik_adult=Banno is a vocalist of the legendary Cancer Choir, for a long time he spent his time in the deep cold depths of the ocean. Sadly though, it was far too cold for his hot water-loving body! Instead of moving into a geyser of some sort, he decided to stay close to his friends, utilizing an endlessly boiling bucket to keep comfy. Whilst his boiling red abdomen may be concerning, there’s no need to worry- Banno states that it’s just his natural color showing after the cleaning of thousands of years of sea gunk.
costume_monster_bannik_adult_2=MONEY!

name_monster_phangler_adult=Phangler
bio_monster_phangler_adult=It appears that the lukewarm waters around the marsh are quite the welcoming enviroment. Many monsters come up to the surface to enjoy them, including the Wadee, the Banno, and more! It appears some monsters also make the land journey at times! One such example is Phangler, who must have adventured all the way from the jungley shore, through the Evergreen Woods to get to the water. Phangler says its arguably the second-sweetest place in the world- and who can blame em?


name_monster_coral_adult=Choralle
bio_monster_coral_adult=Huh? This seems to be an ordinary tree, but consider us fooled, as this is the shy protege of the Cancer Choir, Choralle! These small masters of natural trickery use a tree-like figure for protection, usually hiding from bigger monsters who usually mean no harm, as they just want to say hello! But being the introverted species they are, the Choralle produce a powerful slam with their disguise if someone gets too close. It may seem rude, but it's just instinct, which we can't blame them for.

name_monster_frondley_adult=Frondley
bio_monster_frondley_adult=The Frondley is an ammmmmmmmmmazing specimen! Its gelatinous physique and toes bring to mind some similar monsters, but they have evolved separately from our lemon-colored companions. Their otherworldly and serene hums echo throughout islands, always making sure a Frondley's presence is known. Some monsters go as far as to record these hums to lure themselves to sleep. In other activities, Frondley enjoys maintaining their kelpy hairdos, while always striving to find the perfect amount of hair for their bulbous craniums.
costume_monster_frondley_adult_2=The brave and the bald
costume_monster_frondley_adult_3=Cerberus toy
costume_monster_frondley_adult_4=Pretty & Pampered
costume_monster_frondley_adult_5=Ring-ring!

name_monster_yaga_adult=Stoopa
bio_monster_yaga_adult=Not much is known about the misty marsh deep in the heart of the Evergreen Woods, but legends speak of a strange monster that watches over and leads the song of the monsters that reside there. And whaddya know, here it is! Stoopa is even more of a recycling expert than Congle, finding anything and everything in nature to produce its song, even if it has to make some exceptions with its nature-based rule at times- proven by those... pots and pans on its stupa? Still very little is known about it, and Stoopa prefers to keep it that way while it wields its strange staff, and guards the secrets of the Marsh.
costume_monster_yaga_adult_2=Sweetstaff

name_monster_maulch_adult=Maulch
bio_monster_maulch_adult=Be prepared to get down until you're six feet underground, the Maulch is here! They spend a heavy portion of their days burrowed in the ground beneath, until they pop out, thoroughly energized and ready to bust a dance. Some of Maulch's patent-pending moves include the Soil Shake, the Grime Slide, and the BRAUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHHHH. If you do that last dance move there's a slight chance you'll fall asleep for three days straight. Maulch does it anyways because Maulch does not care what you think is risky.

name_monster_vodyanoy_adult=Wadee
bio_monster_vodyanoy_adult=Deep below the murkiest of murky depths lies an underwater land lost to time. Many monsters have resided here, and in recent times, many from this region have adventured to the surface. If one takes a swim at the foggy center of the Evergreen Woods’ bog pools then you might hear the soggy "why" like sounds of a Wadee, one such explorer. While it was a beautiful fish in the deep, exposure to the surface has fundamentally changed it, causing its gills to shrink, it’s flippers to turn to hands, and it’s body to swell slightly. While seeming minor, these changes mean that the Wadee can no longer make the long underwater trek back home. The Wadee takes it kindly though, and uses its glowing pads to help guide other underwater travelers, and is a friend to many above and below the surface. Deep inside though, Wadee misses the sights of its home coral reef and the sounds of the Cancer Choir’s melodious tunes…
costume_monster_vodyanoy_adult_2=I wanna fly
costume_monster_vodyanoy_adult_3=Burgundy fog

name_monster_likho_adult=Yap
bio_monster_likho_adult=If you see a Yap, just know that you've just run into a nice chap! Yaps are small little tumbleweeds, rolling around picking up all sorts of plant life, and usually gifting some to others, even if they don't like it as much as the gifter. But not only that, when it stops, it prepares a... "wonderful" song for its comrades, which usually results in its audience screaming "MAKE IT STOP!" Don't know what that's about.
costume_monster_likho_adult_2=Super-special density
costume_monster_likho_adult_3=Or so help me!

name_monster_likho_adult_special=Yap (With a special costume)
bio_monster_likho_adult_special=If you see a Yap, just know that you've just run into a nice chap! Yaps are small little tumbleweeds, rolling around picking up all sorts of plant life, and usually gifting some to others, even if they don't like it as much as the gifter. But not only that, when it stops, it prepares a... "wonderful" song for its comrades, which usually results in its audience screaming "MAKE IT STOP!" Don't know what that's about. Also nice costume!

name_monster_leshy_adult=Dulsylvan
bio_monster_leshy_adult=The carved Dulsylvan, a creature of wood and weathering, held together by its solid core, may seem a tad bit rude on first encounter. Known to never speak, and always donning a scowl, Dulsylvan’s bad mood is naught more than circumstance, as it’s mouth has long been cemented in that shape. In truth, the true monster lives in the small creatures that reside upon the only truly life-filled part of the being, it’s lofty twigs. These creatures, sometimes referred to as Sylvlings, cover and open holes on their ailing ancestors branches to allow air through, and giving the Dulsylvan a means of communication with its neighbors. Once Dulsylvan mystically changes into a pine cone, the Sylvlings will begin to grow and change rapidly, into young Dulsylvans of their own!
costume_monster_leshy_adult_2=Spuh-Getty
costume_monster_leshy_adult_3=Fir Sir

name_monsterRare_leshy_adult=Rare
bio_monsterRare_leshy_adult=During the late stages of a Dulsylvan’s time, it’s body begins to rapidly change. Old, solid wood morphs into a light airy shape, known as a sylvcone. The Dulsylvan’s body begins to ooze a sweet sap, that will feed its young Sylvlings after it has passed on, and it’s nose changes to a luscious green shade. While these latter days are considered to be short, they are known to be filled with joy, as the old Dulsylvan becomes able to move freely once more! Eventually though, it slows down, and the sap crystallizes the sylvcone and preserves it for eternity…

name_oaktopus_adult=Oaktopus
bio_oaktopus_adult=Oaktopi are packed full of wisdom to share with the world, about the world. They almost always have an answer to some of life's most burning questions; "Why is the sky blue?", "Is water wet?", and most notably, "Is mayonnaise an instrument?" (The answer is inconclusive, there is no mayonnaise monster). Sometimes they even say outlandish claims of islands once being carried by towering creatures across the monster world. Psh, yeah right. An Oaktopus can usually be seen reading a good book or swimming in a local hot spring. mming in a local hot spring.

name_monsterYoung_flootfly=Flootfly
bio_monsterYoung_flootfly=Young Floot-flies were known as a monster myth for a very very long time until they decided to step into the world and spread their tiny wings across the floating city, some might say that its shooting air sounds from its tube-like snout can make other Young monsters have very good dreams, while others tend to try and see it without its mask on and let's just say that no one has taken a huge gander at it.

name_monsterYoung_theremind=Theremind
bio_monsterYoung_theremind=Young Thereminds may be small, but that doesn't stop them from having giant brains and even bigger ideas! Whilst they aren’t known for their chatter or even much speech at all, they often use their powerful brainwaves to communicate subliminally directly to others and sometimes pry to see what other monsters think about certain controversies…

name_monsterYoung_fluoress=Fluoress
bio_monsterYoung_fluoress=The Young Fluoress is nearly as fluorescent as its adult counterpart, well almost. The Fluoress uses an “RGB” Light grid, while the adult uses an... “ROYGBP”? grid?? I'm getting off track here, The keeper of the Light elements childhood is the most amazing thing any monster can see, it develops from 3 ‘dress’ parts into 6, visible at least…

name_monsterYoung_clackula=Clackula
bio_monsterYoung_clackula=Clackula children are unlike most young monsters, as they are just as asocial and timid as their adult counterparts. It takes a lot of conversation to get a Clackula tot to open up. However, with enough patience and dedication, even the most closed-off clackula can be brought out of its shell! Baby clackula often have a penchant for dancing about in their spare time, and the more outgoing of the bunch will even attempt to sweep an unknowing Fluoress or Candelavra off their feet in the most spectacular of fashion! Though, more often than not, one of their rogue hand-mouths finds a way to snap at their dance partner, providing a suitable explanation as to why most clackula don’t attempt stunts like that a second time.

name_monsterYoung_osstax=Osstax
bio_monsterYoung_osstax=It’s well-known that Osstax begins their lives as a few individuals who join together later in their life. This normally takes many, many years, as they need to fit together perfectly to become a full Osstax, but for the few individuals that find their perfect match early on, you get a scene like this one! Osstak Pebblets, despite being generally sedentary, can come up with all sorts of plans for all sorts of trouble. They’re easily able to plot with the other members of their stak, and use this extra doubled brainpower to be doubly unpredictable. You know what they say, two heads are always better than one!

name_monsterYoung_brump=Brump
bio_monsterYoung_brump=Aww! Those versed in monstrology are well aware of the Brump's... unique physical characteristics. Being made of clay by a lonely wubbox, one wouldn't expect there to be a juvenile form as seen on Floating City, but this little Brumplet not only proves otherwise, it shows that even the slimiest of wublins can be turned cute! Not yet used to their fwoggy feet, Brumplets nonetheless attempt to spend their time ambling about the floating city. Any forward-thinking monster handler will be sure to keep them far away from any cliffs, as to avoid any sort of airborne monster rescue mission!

name_monsterYoung_oaktopus=Oaktopus
bio_monsterYoung_oaktopus=Young Oaktopi are packed full of a need to learn about the world, to share with the world. If they see something, there's a 96.4672345287% chance they'll have something to ask about it. Most questions are about if they can eat various objects. The Young Oaktopus loves broccoli most all, gobbling them up on sight. Other leafy green lovers end up chasing the poor Oaktopus sapling, thinking they're broccoli! Oaktopus tastes like dirty socks. Do not consume the oak. 

name_monsterYoung_yool=Yool
bio_monsterYoung_yool=No one’s better at festive spirit than the Yool! While a mature Yool uses its migratory nature to take a break during the off-season, Yool calves will treat all day every day as if it’s the 12 days of yay, decking the halls and placing presents everywhere it goes. Though, their enthusiasm combined with delicate props means that their yaytide surprises don't often go to plan, leading to startling monsters and broken ornaments. Thank goodness the bells on their antlers give away their location, it’s hard to imagine the types of trouble they’d get into without!

name_monsterYoung_jeeode=Jeeode
bio_monsterYoung_jeeode=While the adult Jeeode is renowned for its conflict resolution skills, babies aren’t usually known for their foresight. Jeeode tufflings are immature and often hold themself to a higher standard they can’t be expected to achieve at such a young age, often leading to a lot of misunderstandings and false judgments. While this pursuit is what would eventually hone their impeccable impartiality, any good friend will try and calm them down before they get too deep in their head. After all, communication is an important part of any relationship, so being crystal clear is especially appreciated!

name_monsterYoung_stogg=Stogg

name_monsterYoung_schmoochle=Schmoochle
bio_monsterYoung_schmoochle=Young Schmoochle bio

name_monster_stone_1=Knottsurr tree
bio_monster_stone_1=This creature, despite not looking sylvan, is an ent. It's the next point in evolution of the Surr trees, conifers found across the Island. It's bark is almost pertified and impenetrable by most of the vermins and predetors. Yet a particular species of "Plantcarver nymph" have developed strong teeth that can gnaw away the stone bark and settle inside of the everblue. The tree's bark is extremely resonant from the inside. Allowing nymths to sing while inside and resonate a deep-throated, ear-piercing sound. The holes carved away by the nymphs resemble a face to scare away unwanted guests and attend on the yearly spooktackle decoration contest.

name_monster_stone_4=BoOoo
bio_monster_stone_4=All those who hail from the Thumpiverse are well versed in the practice of interdimensional leaps, and BoOoo is no exception. Fleeing the abysmal depths of its former home, BoOoo embarked on a long and widespread journey for a new home. Eventually, it found a strange mountain, deep below the Silver Crags, that emitted a strange feeling that resonated with BoOoo. At first staying to investigate, the cryptic aura of the region has convinced BoOoo to finally choose a true home for the first time in millennia. However, no gift comes without its price, and without careful consumption of local materials, the region’s alien magic might take hold on BoOoo and the other residents in strange ways… 


name_monster_stone_5=Mount Tuzzpikk
bio_monster_stone_5=Mount Tuzzpikk was a regular Knott-rock that got affected by the Knottsurr magic, emmited from the mystical orbs found across the Knottsurr Island. It gained musical abilities and immediately after being animated, started to sing. It knows many compositions but "Pearrdesh Slougna" and "Ellepharrth" by "DJ. Goldenduck" is the closest to its rock heart. You can find it humming the melody non-stop whenever it's not singing.\nLeaving the island would result in reverting to its initial state of non-sentience. Unless it carries one of the sources of Knottsurr magic with it wherever it goes.

And seem to never visually change after hitting a milesote of 80 years.\nDespite all of that, there are specimens that had a tragic past and never recovered since. Those exemplars tend to be more aggressive towards everyone around.

name_undof_monster_noggin=Noggin

name_undof_monster_toejammer=Toe Jammer

name_undof_monster_kayna=Kayna
bio_undof_monster_kayna=The ancient Kayna was long thought lost to an enigmatic event in monster antiquity. A solitary specimen encased in amber was rescued on Tribal Island. It's true, but only recently did a new generation of these beings begin to appear, beckoned by the mysterious call of Relics resonating deep within the world's volcanic core. Now, this feisty Fire Elemental is ready to play its part in restoring the glory of its powerful Element in the Monster World.

name_undof_monster_jamboree=Jam boree
bio_undof_monster_jamboree=To say that the Seasonal Shanty is Jam-packed with goodwill and jubilation would be accurate, and that's largely thanks to the presence of the Jam Boree! For many years, the self-styled leader of the Shanty has taken it upon itself to try to organize the Seasonal trappings that festoon every corner of the floating hideaway. It's a very patient Monster, who looks forward every year to Anniversary Month when it throws a huge party for the migratory Seasonals coming home to roost!

name_undof_monster_thrumble=Thrumble
bio_undof_monster_thrumble=Wide-mouthed and keen snackers, Thrumbles are prone to swallowing treats whole. Their elongated gullets can squash and stretch to provide said treats with ample time to be pulverized by the reverberations of this happy-go-lucky hummer's signature thrumming. When thrumming on an empty stomach, bubbling pockets of air can expand and prompt a sudden flurry of giggles!

name_undof_monster_stogg=Stogg
bio_undof_monster_stogg=As avid rock collectors, Stoggs relish digging into the earth with their powerful forelegs to find shiny new minerals. Unfortunately, this absentminded monster also enjoys burying their treasure, often forgetting the location soon after.

name_deco_jar=Spare parts
bio_deco_jar=It's a jar of spare parts! What's it for? Who knows? Are they spare parts for Blipsqueak? Are they spare parts for Handmond just in case its organs fail? Are they even spare parts at all!?

name_deco_jugler=Juggle tulip
bio_deco_jugler=At first glance, this can be easily mistaken for a Monster. But it's just a plant that can juggle anything, mostly eyeballs.

name_deco_bucket=Bucket-o-cattail
bio_deco_bucket=Looks like someone plucked some Cattails from the Evergreen Marsh and put them in a bucket of water to keep them alive! Neat-o!

name_deco_upside-tree=Capsize berry tree
bio_deco_upside-tree=Capsize trees are well-loved throughout the lost landscapes for their delicious berries. They're so delicious in fact, monsters don't often realize the magical side-effect of the berries, where they float up into the air and fall down right on their heads!

name_monster_dancer=The dancer
bio_monster_dancer=The dancer is surrounded by some strange things. The strangest and, perhaps, the creepiest thing is......how.... are you reading this?\nThis should not be available to a common player.....

name_monster_cursed_adult=The thing...
bio_monster_cursed_adult=Oh wow! How are you reading this? Unless you are a tester of this game, I have no idea how you got this.... thing on your island. Oh well!/nThis thing is jsut a test thing I created to test stuff. But I think it will be transformed into a deco. Some kind of pole.

name_deco_baloony=Baloony
bio_deco_baloony=They call him friend substitute. Lonely monsters come to Baloony at any time and share their stories with him. Our "friend" used to fly around freely, exploring the monster world, but he got stuck between two rocks with nothing left to do but to sway serenely from side to side. Nobody knows who created Baloony, but rumors say that it slightly resembles its creation. Who knows, maybe we will meet one day.

name_deco_tlTotem=T.L-Totem
bio_deco_tlTotem=Monsters often spend their time naming the stylized monster heads that make up the T.L-Totem. While the majority of their names are commonly disputed, everyone has somewhat agreed on the bottom thumpie's name being 'Nubert.' My man!

name_deco_heart_tree=Blood blossom tree
bio_deco_heart_tree=Okay... I've seen a lot of disgusting things from the Terra of Organs but this takes the cake! Like what on Galvana's Monster World is that!? It's just- HMMPH! I gotta go to the bathroom... I think I'm gonna throw up...

name_deco_flowers=Floweyes
bio_deco_flowers=Floweyes are a very rare sight in most of the modern monster world. Thought to be relatives of the ockulo tree, Floweyes aren't capable of any riff-like sound, making them wonderful listeners! Most don't try and strike up a conversation, however, because they just won't. stop. STARING.

name_deco_dragoon=Gradoon vessel
bio_deco_dragoon=Gradoons are, quite obviously, relatives to the ancestral Dragoon! It's truly uncanny how similar they are. The ferocious jaws, the finned tail, the serpentine body... what do you mean you don't see the resemblance?

name_deco_tongue_tree=Tung-yucca
bio_deco_tongue_tree=Tung-yuccas, despite appearances, don't consist of genuine monster tongues. Though, that doesn't stop them from leaning over any unsuspecting monster and drooling all over them. Yuck-a!

name_struc_bass=Bass machine
bio_struc_bass=The Bass Machine is a cutting edge mix of art and technology, originating from the age of the Great Burgundy Incident. While the knowledge to create more was lost long ago, many can be found lying around in buildings across the floating city. These strange machines are known to be far more intelligent than any other being within the known realm, but yet cannot communicate with the outside world, leaving them to hum and strum bass notes hoping to be understood…

-----islands
name_island_EM=Evergreen Marsh
bio_island_EM=Lurking in the depths of the "Evergreen woods", the evergrowing "Evergreen marsh" takes place. Despite the motherland of the marsh already being spellworking, the slimy landscape is enchanted evermore with fairy-tale creatures from around the Slav. Legends affirm, that a being once wondered to the quagmire, shall see the world over disparate. Not many relish the change given upon themselves by the bewitched place that is the Evergreen marsh, so be careful, and step lightly, for in the heart of the marsh one’s future is murkier than the swamp water, and cloudier than the emerald dome seen above the wigged top…
